Node.js Basic Concepts
About the Project
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Node.js, including file system operations, event handling, streams, and server creation. It serves as a reference for understanding core Node.js functionalities and modular programming principles.

Features
✅ File system operations (read, write, delete)
✅ Logging events using custom event handlers
✅ Creating a basic web server with HTTP module
✅ Working with Streams for handling large files efficiently
✅ Using Modules and require() for modular development

Technologies Used
Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment
FS Module - File system operations
HTTP Module - Basic server handling
Event Emitter - Custom event handling
Streams - Efficient file processing

Usage
The server.js file runs a basic HTTP server accessible at http://localhost:3000/
logEvents.js logs system events for debugging and monitoring
stream.js handles reading and writing large files efficiently
math.js provides basic mathematical operations
